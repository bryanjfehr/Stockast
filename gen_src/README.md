# Stockast\n\n## Description\nStockast is a comprehensive application designed to empower users with tools to retrieve, analyze, and act upon stock data, specifically focusing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). It provides functionalities for real-time market insights, personalized watchlist management, advanced trading simulations, and AI-driven signal generation and forecasting.\n\n## Key Features\n\n*   **Real-time TSX Stock Data**: Dynamically displays and updates a list of the 50 most active stocks on the TSX, along with real-time quotes.\n*   **Personalized Watchlist Management**: Allows users to create, view, and manage a custom watchlist of stocks, with options for manual or AI-assisted additions.\n*   **Advanced Trading Simulation**: Provides a robust simulation environment for users to test trading strategies with historical and real-time data, including performance tracking and trade history.\n*   **AI-Powered Signal Generation & Forecasting**: Integrates with Google Cloud's Vertex AI to generate trading signals and stock price forecasts, offering intelligent insights.\n*   **Real-time Alerting**: Utilizes WebSockets to deliver instant trading signal alerts and real-time stock data updates directly to authenticated users.\n*   **Historical Data Analysis**: Enables retrieval and analysis of historical daily data for any given stock symbol.\n\n## Technology Stack\n\nStockast is built with a modern, robust technology stack:\n\n*   **Backend**:\n    *   **Python**: Primary language.\n    *   **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs.\n    *   **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.\n    *   **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management.\n    *   **APScheduler**: For scheduling background tasks (e.g., data updates, alert checks).\n    *   **Pandas & TA-Lib**: For data manipulation and technical analysis.\n    *   **Google Cloud AI Platform (Vertex AI)**: For AI-driven signal tuning and forecasting.\n    *   **WebSockets**: For real-time communication.\n*   **Frontend**:\n    *   **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n    *   **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests.\n    *   **React Router DOM**: For declarative routing in the application.\n    *   **Recharts**: Composable charting library for data visualization.\n*   **Database**: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) managed via SQLAlchemy.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to get Stockast up and running on your local machine.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Python 3.8+\n*   Node.js and npm (or yarn)\n*   A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)\n*   (Optional) Google Cloud Platform project with Vertex AI enabled for AI features.\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stockast.git\n    cd stockast\n    ```\n\n2.  **Backend Setup:**\n    ```bash\n    cd backend\n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n    *   **Database Configuration**: Configure your database connection string in a `.env` file. Refer to `backend/.env.example` for required environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT_ID`, `VERTEX_AI_LOCATION`).\n    *   **Database Migrations**: Run database migrations (if applicable, using Alembic or similar tool, not explicitly shown in skeleton but typical for SQLAlchemy projects).\n\n3.  **Frontend Setup:**\n    ```bash\n    cd ../frontend\n    npm install # or yarn install\n    ```\n    *   **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory. Refer to `frontend/.env.example` for required variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`).\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1.  **Start the Backend Server:**\n    From the `backend/` directory:\n    ```bash\n    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n    ```\n    The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.\n\n2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**\n    From the `frontend/` directory:\n    ```bash\n    npm start # or yarn start\n    ```\n    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## Project Structure Overview\n\nThe project is organized into two main directories:\n\n*   `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI application.\n    *   `app/api/`: API endpoints for different modules (users, stocks, watchlist, simulation, settings).\n    *   `app/core/`: Core configurations, security utilities, and settings.\n    *   `app/crud/`: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for database models.\n    *   `app/db/`: Database session management and base models.\n    *   `app/models/`: SQLAlchemy database models (User, Watchlist, StockData, Simulation, Article).\n    *   `app/schemas/`: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and data serialization.\n    *   `app/services/`: Business logic and external service integrations (data fetching, WebSocket management, signal generation, trade simulation, Vertex AI).\
    *   `app/tasks/`: Scheduled background jobs and scheduler setup.\n    *   `app/main.py`: Main FastAPI application entry point, including startup/shutdown events and WebSocket handlers.\n\n*   `frontend/`: Contains the React.js single-page application.\n    *   `src/api/`: API client modules for interacting with the backend.\n    *   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components (common, dashboard, settings, simulation).\n    *   `src/contexts/`: React Context API providers for global state (Auth, WebSocket).\n    *   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks for shared logic.\n    *   `src/pages/`: Top-level page components (Dashboard, Login, Simulation, Settings).\n    *   `src/services/`: Frontend-specific services (e.g., WebSocket service).\n    *   `src/styles/`: Global CSS styles.\n    *   `src/App.js`: Main application component defining routes.\n    *   `src/index.js`: Entry point for the React application.\n
